# Creating a New Tool

This is the process to create a new tool for the Holistic Toolbox

1. Create a new folder in the [`tools`]('/`tools`) folder named appropriately, i.e. json-formatter

2. Add your project to the readme in the [`tools`]('/`tools`) folder

2. Create a readme in this folder documenting the functionality of the tool

3. If the project involves a UI refer to the [`.project/templates/toolbox-ui`](/.project/templates/toolbox-ui) example to set up your project
