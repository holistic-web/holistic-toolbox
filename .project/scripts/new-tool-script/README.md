# New Tool Script

This script generates a new tool for the toolbox. It can be run by navigating to this folder and then:
```
npm install
node . example-tool
```
Where `example-tool` is the name of the new tool.

Once generated follow the steps in the newly generated readme to finish setting up your tool!
