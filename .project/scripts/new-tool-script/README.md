## Factsheet
| **Category**     | **Value**     |

| **Project Type** | Helper Script |

## Generating a Tool
1. open `config.js` from within this folder and set the values you'd like to use

2. run the following from within this folder
	```
	npm install
	node .
	```

3. reset `config.js` to how it was - your tool will be in the `/tools` top level folder =D

4. Follow the steps in the newly generated readme to finish setting up your tool!

## Changing the Template
This script should be fairly resilient to changes in the template structure. This should allow us to update the template as we improve our tools.
