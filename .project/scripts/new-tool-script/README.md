# New Tool Script

This script generates a new tool for the toolbox. To generate a tool:

1. open `config.js` from within this folder and set the values you'd like to use

2. run the following from within this folder
	```
	npm install
	node .
	```

3. reset `config.js` to how it was - your tool will be in the `/tools` top level folder =D

4. Follow the steps in the newly generated readme to finish setting up your tool!
