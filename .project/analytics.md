# Welcome to Analytics

We are using Google Tag Manager to implement Google Analytics. Our analytics scripts are included in the `index.html` files of our web apps and also in our layout project's `index.js.

## This is a tutorial on Analytics for GTM:

- Go to GTM console / Ask to be invited then go
	- [Console Link](https://tagmanager.google.com/#/container/accounts/6000591786/containers/30658965/workspaces/3)
- You can set up tags for Analytics / Ads and more
- To set up custom events for analytics follow the following documentation:
	- [Event Docs](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106716?hl=en&ref_topic=6333310)
- To test whether a new tag is working, go to the GTM console and preview the workspace. Then, in your browser, navigate to the site that you are trying to set up your new tag for. A window should pop up from the bottom of your browser allowing you to explore the tags on that page so long as the overall GTM tag has already been added to said page
- In your event tag, by using the 'GA Default' GTM variable under the 'Google Analytics Settings' option, you will be able to have your event show up in the Google Analytics console
