# Tool Ideas

A list of concepts we have for potential future tools. We should flesh these ideas out wherever possible

## JSON Diff Checker

A quick way to get the diff between two JSON files, useful if the properties aren't in order and to compare values.

## OCR Text Extractor
Extracts text from an image

Some initial questions we should answer are below:

How should we deploy the backend for this tool? Will it be cost effective?

What services do we want to make available in the initial tool?

Could we potentially have multiple front end tools using the same back end service (i.e. face detector)? If so, which?

## Base 64 Image Encoder
Encodes images into base 64 images

## Integer conversions
Converts integers into different formats
