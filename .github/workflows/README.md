# Workflows

This is the list of automated workflows we currently have enabled in the Holistic Toolbox™®.

These will soon be generated.

## Roadmap
- changes that trigger deploy / publish can be skipped if only meta files are affected
- make these trigger on pull request, rather than on push. So we can see a summary of all changes in that PR.
