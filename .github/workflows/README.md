# Workflows

This is the list of automated workflows we currently have enabled in the Holistic Toolbox™®.

These should remain consistent wherever possible and many are generated as part of the tool creation process: [`.project/scripts/new-tool-script`](.project/scripts/new-tool-script)

## Roadmap
- changes that trigger deploy / publish can be skipped if only meta files are affected
- make these trigger on pull request, rather than on push. So we can see a summary of all changes in that PR.
