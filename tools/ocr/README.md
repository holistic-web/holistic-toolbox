# OCR Tool

This is an idea that could be cool but it has a few issues

Can we make this profitable? We will have to research the cost of computing and what kind of service to use

Can we make this secure? Yes but it will probably be difficult. 
There are many considerations and we can't afford to be charged lots of £, $ or €

If we can make it profitable then the process will be as follows:

1. Recieve image from UI

2. Run OCR (probably tesseract as it is free)

3. Display output
