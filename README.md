# Holistic Toolbox

A collection of useful tools, to service all areas of development.

## Tools
To see the list of tools, navigate to the [`tools`](/tools) folder.

## Home
We will build a landing page that links to all of our tools. Soon...

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome, just raise an issue / open a pull request!

### Creating a new tool
See [`.project/processes/creating-new-tool.md`](.project/processes/creating-new-tool.md). If you're looking for inspiration, check out: [`.project/tool-ideas`](.project/tool-ideas).

### Roadmap
- Build a homepage for the Holistic Toolbox itself
- Add a shared eslint library
- Add a menu to the tools layout linking to other tools (when we have them)
- add CI tooling to automate the deployment of sections on merge into master
